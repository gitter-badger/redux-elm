## Action Composition in Practice

You might have spotted one problem with our current implementation, both init functions yields a Side effect which resolves in newly dispatched action `NewGif`, how could our application know which `NewGif` action belongs to which instance of the `GifViewer` Component (Top or Bottom)? We'll utilize Action composition here! So we need to turn:

```javascript
{
  type: 'NewGif',
  url: 'http://media3.giphy....'
}
```

into:

```javascript
{
  type: 'Top.NewGif', // or type: 'Bottom.NewGif'
  url: 'http://media3.giphy....'
}
```

With `redux-elm` it's very easy because library exposes `mapEffects` function which is doing exactly what we need, you can wrap the Updater (or Init function) with `mapEffects` function and all the dispatched actions within yielded Side effects will be automatically wrapped by a parent action, in our specific case all the `dispatched` actions in embed `GifViewer` Component will be "tagged" with `Top` or `Bottom` Action.

```javascript
import { Updater, mapEffects } from 'redux-elm';

import { init as gifViewerInit } from '../gif-viewer/updater';

const funnyCatsGifViewerInit = gifViewerInit('funny cats');
const funnyDogsGifViewerInit = gifViewerInit('funny dogs');

export function* init() {
  return {
    top: yield* mapEffects(funnyCatsGifViewerInit(), 'Top'),
    bottom: yield* mapEffects(funnyDogsGifViewerInit(), 'Bottom')
  };
};

export default new Updater(init).toReducer();

```

After running the application, you should now be able to see in [`redux-devtools-extension`](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) that Actions are actually composed!
